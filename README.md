# be-restated

*be-restated* is one of a trio of element decorators / behaviors that takes advantage of the buried treasure that is XSLT, built into the browser.

The differences are summarized in the table below.

Bottom line, *be-restated* focuses on the following problem statements:

1.  Extracting the data from server-rendered HTML, in partnership with [obj-xml](https://github.com/bahrus/obj-ml).
2.  Providing derived content from other content.  For example, generating a table of contents based on the contents of the page.
